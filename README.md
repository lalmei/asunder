# Asunder 

This project is meant to be used to help and facilitate refactoring python code. The goals are to focus on 'hot' areas, high complexity, churn, potential legacy areas to make programmic refactoring an easier problem to solve. The roadmap also includes using APIs such as the ones from OpenAI to facilitate refactoring and minimize cost. 

Currently, it uses rope as an refactoring engine.
